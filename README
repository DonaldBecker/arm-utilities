This is set of utilities and libraries for low-level and embedded ARM
application development, focused on the STM32 microcontrollers.

The primary utility is stlink-download, a stand-alone command line DUDE
(download/upload/debug) utility for the STM STLink USB-JTAG interface,
as found on the STM32VLDiscovery and related development boards.

The support files include header and library files for a more efficient
alternative to CMSIS and the commercial development systems. The header files
encourage a direct-register-write programming style that largely
eliminates the library call overhead for setting up devices, reducing
code size and increasing speed.

The run-time and linker support is similarly oriented to efficiency and
unabstracted clarity. The only "frill" is enabling all device register
clocks by default to eliminate the most common programming error with
the STM32 series.

This project was originally hoses on Google Code, with documentation
integrated into their environment.  Some was dropped with the migration
to Github.  It will be rewritten if there is interest.
